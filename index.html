        Football is my favourite hobby. It's a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players â€“ field players and a goalkeeper....He's the only person that can touch the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty area.Football is not only my hobby but also help me improve my health. Playing football helps me increase muscle and bone strength, reduce body fat and improve my health due to shift between walking, running and sprinting. Football will build my leg strength and increase my concentration,
